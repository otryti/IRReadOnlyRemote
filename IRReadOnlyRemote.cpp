/**
 * Receive and store IR frames from IR remote controls on an Arduino using the NEC style protocol.
 * This library is suitable for projects that only need to receive (robots?), no sending required.
 * No timer interrupts are used, so it will not interfere with other libraries. Only one hardware interrupt is used.
 *
 * The decoded IR frames are stored in a circular buffer that can store from 1 to 127 frames.
 * The default is 15 frames, change IR_BUF_SIZE for other sizes (size must be a power of 2). The capacity
 * of the buffer is one less than the defined size.
 * The processing needs are very low, the Interrupt Service Routine is called only on input pin state change.
 *
 * There is no need to retrieve the frames from the buffer as soon as they arrive. This enables the main program
 * to read the frames when it has time, and is not constrained by a requirement to read the frames as soon as they arrive
 * (as long as the buffer does not overflow) in order to not lose any frames.
 *
 * The NEC style protocol consists of a header mark, a header space, and a number of bit marks and bit spaces.
 * The length of the bit mark is always the same.
 * The length of the bit space determines if the bit is a 0 or a 1.
 * There can be a repeat frame (ditto).
 *
 * For a NEC remote, the constructor would be called like this:
 *
 * With the NEC_ONLY define set to 1:
 * IRReadOnlyRemote remote(2);
 * This means: Use pin 2 for the IR detector. All other values are set by defines.
 *
 * With the NEC_ONLY define set to 0:
 * IRReadOnlyRemote remote(2, 564, 16, 8, 4, 1, 1, 3, 32);
 * This means: Use pin 2 for the IR detector, the base time unit (btu) is 564 microseconds, the header mark is 16 btu long,
 * the header space is 8 btu long, the repeat header space is 4 btu long, the bit mark is 1 btu long,
 * the zero space is 1 btu long, the one space is 3 btu long, and finally, the frame contains 32 bits.
 * A Samsung TV remote (BN59-01175N) works with this:
 * IRReadOnlyRemote remote(2, 564, 8, 8, 0, 1, 1, 3, 32);
 *
 * See http://www.hifi-remote.com/johnsfine/DecodeIR.html for a large number of IR protocols.
 * See IRLibReference Appendix B (.docx or .pdf) at https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib2/tree/master/IRLib2/manuals
 * for an explanation of the IRP notation that is understandable (the one in DecodeIR.html isn't).
 *
 * Only one function needs to be called - read() - which will return the next frame (if any) from the frame buffer.

/**
 * The Interrupt Service Routine is called for each state change of the interrupt pin.
 * It will listen for a header mark followed by a header space, and then codeLength pairs of
 * bit mark and bit space. Each time a bit mark arrives after a bit space, the value (0 or 1) of the
 * bit space is added to a variable irData.
 *
 * When the IR frame is finished with a last stop mark, a certain amount of time is supposed to elapse
 * before the frame is considered complete.
 * This represents a problem here, since if there are no more IR frames to be received, there will be
 * no more interrupts to process.
 * In order to do this correctly, a timer interrupt would have to be issued when an appropriate amount of time
 * has passed. But we do not wish to use any more resources (timer interrupts) than we have to.
 * An alternative (as used in IRremote/IRLib/IRLib2) is to require the routine reading the codes to do so in
 * a fairly tight loop, making it possible for the function called to check if the space after the stop bit is long
 * enough to consider the frame complete.
 * We do not wish to impose this requirement either, so a calculated risk is taken: When the stop mark ends, the frame
 * is considered complete and the result is placed in the output buffer.
 *
 * The next mark to arrive must be a header mark for the decoding process to start up again.
